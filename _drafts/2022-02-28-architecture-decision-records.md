# Architecture Decision Record
Coined by Michael Nygard, an Architectural Decision Record (or ADR, for short) is an artefact that captures the context and consequences of a decision addressing an architecturally-significant requirement. Nygard also summarised that requirements become architecturally significant when they affect; structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces or construction techniques.
