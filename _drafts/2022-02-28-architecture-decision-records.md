# Architecture Decision Record
Coined by Michael Nygard, an Architecture Decision Record (or ADR, for short) is a lightweight artefact capturing the motivation behind an architecturally-significant decision. The reason for a decision isn't always apparent, and this often leads developers into a rabbit hole of exploration and questions. Better clarity behind these decisions helps align development teams toward the desired architecture.
