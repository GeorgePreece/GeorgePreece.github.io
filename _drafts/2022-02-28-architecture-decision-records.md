# Architecture Decision Record
Coined by Michael Nygard, an Architecture Decision Record (or ADR, for short) is a lightweight artefact capturing the motivation behind an architecturally-significant decision. The reasoning for decisions is not always apparent, and this often leads developers into a rabbit hole of exploration and questions. Better clarity behind these decisions helps align development teams toward the desired architecture.

ADRs address architecturally-significant requirements. The project team should define what they consider architecturally significant, however, a good rule of thumb is: if the decision is costly/expensive to unwind, it is significant.
